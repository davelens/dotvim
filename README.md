# .vim/
> This is my [vimrc](https://github.com/davelens/dotvim/blob/master/vimrc). There are many like it, but this one is mine. My vimrc is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my vimrc is useless. Without my vimrc, I am useless.

My configuration for the world's greatest text editor.

## neovim? What about regular vim?
In september 2019 I made the switch to Neovim with its release of 0.4. Mostly
because I was dealing with large files at the time. In Rails, files like i18n
files or data logs are so much more responsive in neovim compared to stock vim. 

Thankfully, both vim and neovim are mostly backwards compatible, and I try to
do the same with my vimrc.

## Changelog
As of march 2020 I created [a separate changelog](https://github.com/davelens/dotvim/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) 
for my .vimrc which I'll attempt to maintain, in order to explain some of my
reasoning to my future self.
