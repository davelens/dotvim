- [x] Fix <Tab> behaviour by writing custom logic for nvim-cmp.
- [ ] See if nvim-cmp and Copilot issues I had could be solved using zbirenbaum/copilot-cmp instead.
- [ ] vim-endwise does not work; find a solution
- [ ] No more selectable ruby block textobjects available for motions. 
nelstrom/vim-textobj-rubyblock does not work in Lua, so find a modern solution.
- [ ] nvim-ts-autotag does not properly format tags when they autoclose. I want:
<ul> <!-- After pressing ">" I expect to get a newline + autoclose + formatting.
  CURSOR
</ul>
- [ ] Elixir's Intellisense autocomplete seems worse than I remember it being with coc-elixir.
See/ask around on Discord how I can improve this.
